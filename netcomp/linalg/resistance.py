def resistance_matrix(A, check_connected=True):
    """Return the resistance matrix of G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : NumPy matrix or SciPy sparse matrix
        Adjacency matrix of a graph.

    check_connected : Boolean, optional (default=True)
        If false, then the resistance matrix will be computed even for
        disconnected matrices. See Notes.

    Returns
    -------
    R : NumPy matrix
       Matrix of pairwise resistances between nodes.

    Notes
    -----
    Uses formula for resistance matrix R in terms of Moore-Penrose of
    pseudoinverse (non-normalized) graph Laplacian. See e.g. Theorem 2.1 in [1]. 

    This formula can be computed even for disconnected graphs, although the
    interpretation in this case is unclear. Thus, the usage of
    check_connected=False is recommended only to reduce computation time in a
    scenario in which the user is confident the graph in question is, in fact,
    connected.

    Since we do not expect the pseudoinverse of the laplacian to be sparse, we
    convert L to dense form before running np.linalg.pinv(). The returned
    resistance matrix is dense.

    To renormalize a resistance R, we apply the function

    In this way, the renormalized resistance of nodes in disconnected components
    is 1. The parameter beta determines the penalty for disconnection. If we set
    beta to be approximately the maximum resistance found in the network, then
    the penalty for disconnection is at least 1/2.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : NumPy matrix or SciPy sparse matrix
        Adjacency matrix of a graph.

    nodelist : list, optional
       The rows and columns are ordered according to the nodes in nodelist. If
       nodelist is None, then the ordering is produced by G.nodes().

    weight : string or None, optional (default='weight')
       The edge data key used to compute each value in the matrix.
       If None, then each edge has weight 1.

    beta : float, optional
       Scaling parameter in renormalization. Must be greater than or equal to
       1. Determines how heavily disconnection is penalized.

    Returns
    -------
    R :  NumPy array
       Matrix of pairwise renormalized resistances between nodes.

    Notes
    -----
    This function converts to a NetworkX graph, as it uses the algorithms
    therein for identifying connected components.
