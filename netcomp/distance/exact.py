    Parameters
    ----------
    A1, A2 : NumPy matrices

    Notes
    -----
    The norm can be any p-norm; by default we use p=2. If p<0 is used, the
    result is not a mathematical norm, but may still be interesting and/or
    useful.

    If k is provided, then we use the k SMALLEST eigenvalues for the Laplacian
    distances, and we use the k LARGEST eigenvalues for the adjacency
    distance. This is because the corresponding order flips, as L = D-A.
